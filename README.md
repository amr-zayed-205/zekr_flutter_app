# 🌿 Azkar App (Flutter)

A simple and clean Flutter application for daily Azkar, designed with smooth navigation, clear counters, and an intuitive user experience.

---

## 📱 Overview

This application helps users read and follow daily Azkar in an organized and distraction-free way.

The app is divided into:

- A **Main Screen** that acts as a hub.
- **Three Azkar Screens** that share the same layout but display different content.

Each screen focuses on clarity, ease of navigation, and continuity while reading.

---

## 🏠 Main Screen

The main screen contains **three main buttons**.

Each button navigates the user to a different Azkar page:

1. Morning Azkar
2. Evening Azkar
3. Post-Prayer Azkar

Each page displays different Azkar data while keeping the same UI structure for consistency.

## 📄 Azkar Screens (Shared Layout)

All Azkar pages share the same design but load different content depending on the selected category.

This approach ensures:

- Consistent user experience
- Easier maintenance
- Better scalability

### Pages Included

- Morning Azkar
- Evening Azkar
- Post-Prayer Azkar

---

## 🔁 Navigation & Controls

Each Azkar screen contains the following controls:

### ⬅️➡️ Navigation Buttons

- **Next Button**: Moves to the next Zikr
- **Previous Button**: Returns to the previous Zikr

---

### 🔢 Counter Button

Each Zikr has a repetition counter.

- The counter decreases with each tap
- Once the counter reaches zero, the app automatically navigates to the next Zikr

This allows the user to focus on reading without manual counting.

---

### 🏠 Back to Home Button

At the top-left corner, a button allows the user to return to the **Main Screen** at any time.
